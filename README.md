# hamburgerMenu
Hamburger menu implemented for dynamic design

Intended for portability and usability. Since most traffic nowadays comes from mobile devices it is important to make websites both accessible on as many devices as possible and easy to use. 

Smaller screens require different properties to achieve this.

-Bigger fonts
-Elements with wider widths
-Emphasis on simplicity
-Vertical layout
-Fewer elements

Changes on design are made on .ready() function both when page loads and when page is resized.
